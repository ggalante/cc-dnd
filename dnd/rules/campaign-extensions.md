# Campaign Rules Extensions

_Campaign-specific rules annotations for this game. Injected into the Rules Lawyer alongside the base ruleset. Does not override base rules — adds specificity on top of them._

_Update this file when characters level up, acquire significant abilities, or when the DM establishes a campaign-specific ruling that doesn't belong in the base ruleset._

## Active Optional Rules

- **Flanking**: Not active. Two allies on opposite sides of an enemy do not grant advantage in this campaign.

## Notes for Rules Lawyer

- All four characters are SRD-compatible at level 3
- Characters will level up during the campaign — update this file when they do
- Zyx's Portent dice should be recorded in `world/current-state.md` at session start and consumed from there
- Midge's Halfling Lucky and Zyx's Portent interact as follows: Lucky applies before Portent replacement is possible; if Portent replaces the roll, Lucky cannot then trigger on the Portent die
