# Multi-Agent Tabletop RPG Engine

Run a tabletop RPG campaign where AI agents play the characters. The Dungeon Master, each player character, and a Rules Lawyer are all separate agents that communicate through a shared set of markdown files. Everything is versioned in git.

Works with Claude Code, the Claude API, or any multi-agent AI system that supports tool use and spawning subagents (Gemini, GPT-4o with function calling, etc.). The markdown files are the universal state layer — any LLM can read them.

This repository contains an active campaign: **Aldenmere**, a post-adventure fantasy world where the danger is returning after 50 years of peace, played with four AI-driven characters using DnD 5e 2024 (SRD).

## Quick Start

**Fork this repo, then:**

1. **Delete or replace the campaign files** in `dnd/characters/`, `dnd/memory/`, and `dnd/world/` with your own, using the templates in `dnd/rules/srd-5e-2024/character-template.md` and the existing world files as a guide.

2. **Choose your ruleset** by editing `dnd/rules/active-ruleset.md`. The default is DnD 5e 2024 SRD (safe to publish). For other systems, see [Changing the Ruleset](#changing-the-ruleset).

3. **Fill in `dnd/rules/campaign-extensions.md`** with your party's character stats. This is what the Rules Lawyer uses to check mechanical correctness — keep it updated as characters level up.

4. **Commit everything** to git before starting. The agents read from the files on disk.

5. **Start the game.** Open a Claude Code session and say: `Start Session 1.`

The DM agent reads the world state, spawns player agents with their character context, and begins narrating. No further input needed.

For a full setup walkthrough, see [`dnd/meta/architecture.md`](dnd/meta/architecture.md).

## How It Works

```
Dungeon Master (orchestrating agent)
    │
    ├── spawns ──► Player agent (reads character file + memory journal)
    ├── spawns ──► Player agent
    ├── spawns ──► Player agent
    ├── spawns ──► Player agent
    │
    └── spawns ──► Rules Lawyer (after each combat round, advisory only)
```

- **Player agents are stateless** — all memory lives in markdown files injected into each call
- **Journals accumulate** — each player's `memory/<name>-journal.md` grows with opinions, memories, and emotional state across sessions, giving agents continuity of character
- **Inter-player dialogue** is relayed by the DM; players build relationships through their journals
- **Rules Lawyer** reviews the full combat round as a batch; DM accepts or overrules — the DM always has final say
- **Everything is committed to git** — sessions, rulings, character memories, world state

## Changing the Ruleset

The ruleset is a plugin. To switch systems:

1. Edit `dnd/rules/active-ruleset.md` to point at a new ruleset directory
2. Create the directory with the required files (see `dnd/rules/README.md` for the spec)
3. Rebuild character sheets using the new system's `character-template.md`
4. Update `dnd/rules/campaign-extensions.md` for the new system's mechanics

> **Do this before Session 1.** Changing rulesets mid-campaign causes agents to operate on inconsistent rule systems. If you want a different system, start a new campaign.

**Proprietary systems** (full DnD 5e beyond SRD, Daggerheart, Pathfinder, etc.): place your ruleset in `dnd/rules/private/`. This directory is gitignored. Do not publish AI-generated content based on proprietary rules.

| System | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| DnD 5e 2024 SRD | ✓ Included, default | CC BY 4.0 — safe to publish |
| DnD 5e 2024 (full) | Private only | Place in `rules/private/` |
| Daggerheart | Private only | Requires new quickref + character template |
| Dungeon World | Private only | PbtA — different action resolution |
| Pathfinder 2e | Private only | Requires new quickref + character template |

## Using a Different AI System

The engine is not Claude-specific. The markdown files are plain text — any LLM can read them. To adapt for another system:

- **Gemini / GPT-4o / other**: Implement the same orchestration pattern — a main agent that reads the state files and spawns subagents with injected context. The file structure and injection logic is documented in `dnd/meta/architecture.md`.
- **Custom agent frameworks**: The five context files injected per player call (character, journal, story-so-far, current-state, scene prompt) are the interface. Any framework that can pass these as context to a subagent will work.

## Legal Notes

**Default ruleset (SRD)**: `dnd/rules/srd-5e-2024/` is based on the [Systems Reference Document 5.2](https://www.dndbeyond.com/srd) licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Session logs generated using this ruleset may be published freely.

**Campaign content** (Aldenmere, the four characters, the story): original creative work, not derived from any proprietary source.

**Proprietary rulesets**: Do not publish AI-generated content based on systems you don't have rights to publish. The `rules/private/` gitignore is a safeguard, not a license.

PRs welcome for improvements to the architecture, agent prompting strategies, or the ruleset plugin system. Campaign-specific content (the Aldenmere characters and story) is specific to this playthrough.
